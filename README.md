<h2>Hey my name is Sean Filimon</h2>

### 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me

I am an ambitious entrepreneur looking to expand my business into several industries, such as digital marketing, computer software, and B2B services. In terms of professional work, I have been programming for about three years, and in terms of personal work, I have been doing it for seven years. Those looking for a partner in business can also contact me for freelance business development or software development commissions.

In my role as a member of the Computer Science/Cybersecurity Industry, I am committed to helping everyone with personal development and to creating new opportunities for those who wish to enter the field. I would be glad to assist you with any project or answer any Full-Stack Developer questions.

In addition, I provide Free Consulting in regards to any Networking / Software-related issues or tasks. 
Whether it is B2B (OpticEngine) or B2C (Personal), I can provide you with services such as Software Development and Graphics Design, as well as Digital Marketing services.
